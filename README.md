# Extended pdfinfo (based on Xpdf 3.04)

This is an extended version of `pdfinfo`. 

This provides a new option `-extractbb`. This option forces `pdfinfo` to act as if it were `extractbb`. By using this option, you can invoke `\includegraphics` to include any page of a multiple-page PDF.

## How to compile

```sh
$ ./configure
$ make pdfinfo
```

## Usage

See [my blog](http://doratex.hatenablog.jp/entry/20141203/1417555607) for details.
